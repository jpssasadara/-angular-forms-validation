Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).[7] The disease was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, the capital of China's Hubei province, and has since spread globally, resulting in the ongoing 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic.[8][9] Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.[10] Other symptoms may include muscle pain, sputum production, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of smell, and abdominal pain.[4][11][12] While the majority of cases result in mild symptoms, some progress to viral pneumonia and multi-organ failure.[8][13] As of 28 March 2020, the overall rate of deaths per number of diagnosed cases is 4.7 percent; ranging from 0.2 percent to 15 percent according to age group and other health problems.[14] In comparison, the mortality rate of the 1918 flu pandemic was approximately 3% to 5%.[15]

The virus is spread mainly through close contact and via respiratory droplets produced when people cough or sneeze.[16][17] Respiratory droplets may be produced during breathing but the virus is not generally airborne.[16][18] People may also contract COVID-19 by touching a contaminated surface and then their face.[16][17] It is most contagious when people are symptomatic, although spread may be possible before symptoms appear.[17] The virus can survive on surfaces up to 72 hours.[19] Time from exposure to onset of symptoms is generally between two and fourteen days, with an average of five days.[10][20] The standard method of diagnosis is by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) from a nasopharyngeal swab.[21] The infection can also be diagnosed from a combination of symptoms, risk factors and a chest CT scan showing features of pneumonia.[22][23]

Recommended measures to prevent infection include frequent hand washing, social distancing (maintaining physical distance from others, especially from those with symptoms), covering coughs and sneezes with a tissue or inner elbow, and keeping unwashed hands away from the face.[24][25] The use of masks is recommended for those who suspect they have the virus and their caregivers.[26] Recommendations for mask use by the general public vary, with some authorities recommending against their use, some recommending their use, and others requiring their use.[27][28][29] Currently, there is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19. Management involves treatment of symptoms, supportive care, isolation, and experimental measures.[30]

The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the 2019–20 coronavirus outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC)[31][32] on 30 January 2020, and a pandemic on 11 March 2020.[9] Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in many countries across all six WHO regions.[33]
